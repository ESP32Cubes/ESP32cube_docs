# Software Development

The tutorial examples and code can be found in the following repositories:

[ESP32Cube_S3](https://github.com/ESP32Cubes/ESP32Cube_S3)
  
## Development Environment Setup

In this tutorial, we will use the VS Code extension for the ESP-IDF to develop applications for the ESP32-S3.

With VS Code, we can easily develop, debug, and deploy applications for the ESP32-S3. At the same time, we can also use other VS Code extensions help speed up the development process.

To get started, follow the steps below:
1. Install VS Code.
2. Install the ESP-IDF extension for VS Code.
3. Clone the ESP32-S3 repository.
4. Open the cloned repository in VS Code.
5. Set up the development environment.

### Install VS Code

Download and install the latest version of VS Code from the official website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Follow the installation instructions to complete the installation.

### Install the ESP-IDF Extension for VS Code

Open VS Code and go to the Extensions tab on the left side of the window. Search for "ESP-IDF" and install the "ESP-IDF extension for VS Code".

### Configure the ESP-IDF Extension

After installing the ESP-IDF extension, you need to configure it to download the required tools and SDKs.
Click the ESP-IDF extension icon on the left side of the VS Code window and select "Configure ESP-IDF extension".

Click "Install" to download the required tools and SDKs.

It will take **quite a long time** to complete the download. Fortunately, it only needs to be done once.

### ESP-IDF Extension Bottom Toolbar in VS Code

After installing the **ESP-IDF Extension** in VS Code, the bottom toolbar provides quick access to essential development tools. Below is a detailed explanation of each button‚Äôs functionality:

![[images/Pasted image 20250302192958.png]]

#### 1. Select Target Chip (ESP-IDF: Device)

- **Icon**: üéØ  
- **Purpose**: Choose the target ESP chip (e.g., `esp32`, `esp32s3`, `esp32c3`).  
- **Usage**:  
  - Click to open a dropdown list of supported ESP chips.  
  - Select the chip matching your hardware (e.g., `esp32s3` for ESP32-S3 boards).  

#### 2. Select COM Port (ESP-IDF: Port)

- **Icon**: üîå  
- **Purpose**: Choose the serial port connected to your ESP device.  
- **Usage**:  
  - Click to list available COM ports (e.g., `COM3`, `/dev/ttyUSB0`).  
  - Select the port your ESP board is connected to.  

#### 3. Set Build Target (ESP-IDF: Build Target)

- **Icon**: üõ†Ô∏è  
- **Purpose**: Configure project-specific build settings (e.g., flash size, partition scheme).  
- **Usage**:  
  - Opens `menuconfig` interface to adjust settings like Wi-Fi stack, Bluetooth, or peripheral configurations.  

#### 4. Clean Project (ESP-IDF: Clean)

- **Icon**: üóëÔ∏è  
- **Purpose**: Delete build artifacts and start a fresh compilation.  
- **Usage**:  
  - Click to clean the `build` directory. Useful after major code changes or configuration updates.  
#### 5. Build Project (ESP-IDF: Build)

- **Icon**: ‚öôÔ∏è  
- **Purpose**: Compile the project source code into firmware binaries.  
- **Usage**:  
  - Click to start compilation. Output logs appear in the terminal.  

#### 6. Flash Firmware (ESP-IDF: Flash)

- **Icon**: ‚ö°  
- **Purpose**: Upload the compiled firmware to the ESP device.  
- **Usage**:  
  - Ensure the correct COM port and target chip are selected.  
  - Click to flash the `.bin` files to the device.  

#### 7. Open Serial Monitor (ESP-IDF: Monitor)

- **Icon**: üì∫  
- **Purpose**: View real-time serial output (debug logs, printf statements).  
- **Usage**:  
  - Opens a terminal window to display logs from the ESP device.  
  - Supports sending commands to the device (if configured).  

#### 8. One-Click Build+Flash+Monitor (ESP-IDF: Build, Flash and Monitor)

- **Icon**: üî•  
- **Purpose**: Automate compilation, flashing, and serial monitoring in one step.  
- **Usage**:  
  - Click to sequentially:  
    1. **Build** the project.  
    2. **Flash** the firmware.  
    3. **Open** the serial monitor.  

#### 9. Select ESP-IDF Version (ESP-IDF: SDK Version)

- **Icon**: üì¶  
- **Purpose**: Switch between installed ESP-IDF framework versions.  
- **Usage**:  
  - Click to choose a version (e.g., `v5.1.2`, `v5.2.1`).  
  - Required for compatibility with specific projects or libraries.  

#### 10. Task Manager (ESP-IDF: Task)

- **Icon**: üìã  
- **Purpose**: View and manage active ESP-IDF tasks (e.g., build, flash jobs).  
- **Usage**:  
  - Click to see running processes or cancel tasks.  

#### Example Workflow

1. **Select Target**: Choose `esp32s3`.  
2. **Select COM Port**: Pick the connected port (e.g., `COM4`).  
3. **Configure**: Adjust settings via `menuconfig` if needed.  
4. **Build**: Compile the code.  
5. **Flash**: Upload firmware to the board.  
6. **Monitor**: Debug logs in real time.  

#### Notes

- **Dependencies**: Ensure drivers (e.g., CH340 for USB-UART) and ESP-IDF tools are installed.  
- **Shortcuts**: Many buttons have keyboard shortcuts (hover over icons for tooltips).  
This toolbar streamlines ESP32 development by integrating critical tasks into a single interface, reducing context switching between tools.
